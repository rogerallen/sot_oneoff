# sot

Simplest Overtone [standalone] Test -- "oneoff" variant.

## Usage

First, install the oneoff https://github.com/mtyaka/lein-oneoff.  In
lein1, I think you can follow the instructions on the page.  In lein2,
you need to add to the :user :plugins map.

The goal is to hear a 440Hz sine wave for a few seconds after doing only this:

    lein oneoff sot.clj
